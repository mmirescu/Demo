# Optimal-Electricity-Generating-Portfolios

Develop a Non-Linear Optimisation Model for Determining the Cost-Efficient Portfolio from the Technologies: Gas, Coal, Nuclear and Onshore Wind

* Udacity - Machine Learning Nanodegree: Demo Example*

## Project Overview

In this project the goal is to optimally determine the cheapest and most efficient portfolio of technologies for generating electricity while satisfying certain given load constraints.
For the sake of simplicity the focus of this project is laid upon the following 4 technologies: coal, gas, nuclear and onshore wind. From a methodological point of view, the model can be
positioned in the realm of constrained non-linear programming and is solved numerically, via sequential quadratic programming. As a case study, the model is applied to German data.
